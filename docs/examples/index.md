# Examples

These runnable examples cover control, JAX transformations, pipeline extensions, rendering, contacts, and Gymnasium environments. Start with hover if you're new, or jump to the section that matches your use case.

---

## Hover

A single drone commanded to hold a fixed height using state control. This is the minimal end-to-end loop: create a `Sim`, reset it, apply a state command, and step forward.

```{ .python notest }
--8<-- "examples/control/hover.py"
```

```bash
python examples/control/hover.py
```

---

## Attitude control

Commanding roll, pitch, yaw, and collective thrust directly. This level bypasses the Mellinger position loop and is typical for RL agents that output attitude targets.

```{ .python notest }
--8<-- "examples/control/attitude.py"
```

---

## Sampling-based MPC

A sampling-based model predictive controller tracks a Lissajous curve while avoiding a grid of obstacles. It rolls out thousands of candidate control sequences in parallel using a reduced dynamics model, then applies the first action from a cost-weighted update of the best samples. The controller automatically uses a GPU when one is available and lowers the sample count on CPU.

```bash
python examples/control/sampling.py
```

---

## Gradient descent through dynamics

Because the simulator is built entirely from JAX operations, `jax.grad` can differentiate through it. Starting the drone above the target height keeps it away from the floor, so the floor-clipping stage never fires and gradients flow freely through the entire trajectory.

```{ .python notest }
--8<-- "examples/jax/gradient.py"
```

---

## Domain randomization

Randomizing mass and inertia through the reset pipeline. An optional mask limits randomization to selected worlds.

```{ .python notest }
--8<-- "examples/plugins/randomize.py"
```

```bash
python examples/plugins/randomize.py
```

---

## Disturbance injection

Inserting a random external force and torque into the step pipeline. The disturbance fires on every dynamics tick, so the drone fights wind-like perturbations.

```{ .python notest }
--8<-- "examples/plugins/disturbance.py"
```

---

## Cameras and RGBD

Offscreen rendering returns RGB and depth images on every frame. The FPV camera (`fpv_cam`) is attached to the drone and moves with it.

<figure class="example-media">
  <img src="../img/examples/cameras.gif" alt="RGB and depth camera outputs from a Crazyflow drone simulation">
</figure>

```{ .python notest }
--8<-- "examples/rendering/cameras.py"
```

```bash
python examples/rendering/cameras.py
```

---

## LED deck and materials

`change_material` updates the RGBA colour and emission of any named material on any subset of drones at runtime.

<figure class="example-media example-media--compact">
  <img src="../img/examples/led_decks.png" alt="Crazyflow drones with runtime-controlled LED deck materials">
</figure>

```{ .python notest }
--8<-- "examples/rendering/led_deck.py"
```

```bash
python examples/rendering/led_deck.py
```

---

## Contact queries

The default collision geometry is a sphere around the drone frame. `use_box_collision` replaces it with a tighter oriented box, useful for narrow-gap flight and accurate contact debugging.

<div class="example-media-grid example-media-grid--contacts">
  <figure>
    <img src="../img/examples/contact_sphere.png" alt="Contact query visualization using the default sphere collision geometry">
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../img/examples/contact_box.png" alt="Contact query visualization using the oriented box collision geometry">
  </figure>
</div>

```{ .python notest }
--8<-- "examples/contacts/contacts.py"
```

---

## Raycasting and depth sensing

`render_depth` fires rays from a camera and returns per-pixel distances. This is faster than full RGB rendering and useful for obstacle sensing or depth-based controllers.

```{ .python notest }
--8<-- "examples/rendering/raycasting.py"
```

```bash
python examples/rendering/raycasting.py
```

---

## Gymnasium environment

Evaluating a random policy in the figure-8 environment. The env wraps `Sim` behind the standard Gymnasium `VectorEnv` interface.

```{ .python notest }
--8<-- "examples/environments/figure8.py"
```
